Present: Stephan, Matthijs, Alex, Yin, Thomas (TA)
Absent: Nils (left), Axel (left)

1. The meeting is opened at 14:00.
2. Axel left last week and now Nils also left.
3. JSON is incomplete. We need to add drivers, mechanics etc. without a team.
4. Because of the screen size difficulties we had, we have decide to design and set to the default screen size to 1920x1080.
5. We updated the board of sprint 1 and created a board for sprint 2.
6. Planning of sprint 2. We decided not to change the planning, because the team members that left were not very productive anyway. So we are not too bothered by it at the moment. If needed we can still adjust the planning later.
7. For the next sprint we have the following goal:
    - The goal of this sprint is to allow the user to play an entire season with predefined teams or create your own new team with your selected staff. For each race the user is able to select the strategy and setup. After the race the user will see all the results of the race. The game processes the race data (finances, points, wins) and the user can go to the next race.
8. We should take into account when the game ends.
9. Next meeting is on Friday at 12:45. We need to reserve a project room for this meeting.
10. The meeting is closed at 14:30.
