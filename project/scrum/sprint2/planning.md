# Sprint goal
The goal of this sprint is to allow the user to play an entire season with predefined teams or create your own new team with your selected staff. For each race the user is able to select the strategy and setup. After the race the user will see all the results of the race. The game processes the race data (finances, points, wins) and the user can go to the next race.

## Meetings
We have decided to have meetings two predetermined days in the week: wednesdays and fridays. On other days we will work either individually or in pairs.

## Issues or concerns before sprint
We have lost two of our team members. So we needed to check if had to adjust our planning. We decided not to change the planning, because the team members that left were not very productive anyway. So we are not too bothered by it at the moment. If needed we can still adjust the planning later.

## Deadlines
- 21-12-2016: demo 2 - Next version GUI, initial version of team configuration
