# F2 Coureurs
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/F2-Coureurs/F2-Coureurs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/F2-Coureurs/F2-Coureurs)

## Goal of project
Through this project, we want to improve our programming skills using the knowledge we have gained. We are aiming to build a fully-functional, well-working software system from a “vague” assignment, make a beneficial use of version control, set up a proper UML class diagram and realistic planning. We aspire to be “lazy” in a smart and safe way.

The end-result of this project is a game called ‘F1 Manager’. This game allow the player to build his/her own Formula 1 team with a budget. Examples of things the player can change in this team are the driver, the strategist, the aerodynamics and the engine. During the game the team will compete in a Formula 1 season. The team (that can be edited before every race) gets money for every scored point in a race. The player wins if at the end of a season the team has scored the most points.
